Working with FreeSurfer - let's take care of the anatomy

""" Now we need to do a couple of things outside of Spyder.

    1. Make sure that FreeSurfer is installed and find the subjects directory.
    2. Make sure the subjects directory doesn't have a subject called 'sample'.
    3. Check that we have a valid MR file (e.g. with freview)
    4. Create a subject called 'sample' with MRI file 'MRI.mgz'
       > recon-all -i ~/source_modeling_course/data/MEG/MRI.mgz -subjid sample
    5. Check that the subject 'sample' is created.
    6. Run the full FreeSurfer pipeline
       > recon-all -all -subjid sample
       The pipeline runs for several hours, so we will cheat by copying 
       ~/source_modeling_course/data/precomputed/sample to the
       subjects folder.
